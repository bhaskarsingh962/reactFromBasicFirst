*******************NPX (Node Package Executor)
📌 NPX is used to execute Node packages without installing them globally.

🔹 Why use NPX?

Run CLI tools without global installation.

Automatically fetch the latest package version.

Useful for one-time commands.

🔹 Common Uses:

Running a package without installing:

npx package-name
Running create-react-app (without installing globally):

npx create-react-app my-app
Checking Node.js version:


npx node -v
👉 Example: Running json-server without installing

npx json-server --watch db.json
🆚 NPM vs. NPX: Quick Comparison
Feature	NPM	NPX
Purpose	Install/manage packages	Execute packages directly
Installation	Needs explicit install (npm install package)	No need to install globally
Usage	Used for managing dependencies	Used for running one-time commands
Example	npm install react	npx create-react-app my-app
When to Use What?
✅ Use npm when you want to install dependencies for your project.
✅ Use npx when you want to run a command-line tool without installing it globally.




--> npm i -D parcel = install parcel -> heyphone D is two type od dependecies 
 1- devdepenedecies - development(using react that time use D)
 2- normal depencies - normal production

 Parcel Cache: What It Is & How It Works
📌 What is Parcel Cache?
Parcel caches files to speed up build times. Instead of rebuilding everything from scratch, Parcel stores previously built files and reuses them when possible.

👉 The cache is stored in the .parcel-cache/ folder inside your project.

🔍 Why Does Parcel Use Caching?
Speeds Up Rebuilds → Only changed files are recompiled.

Reduces Processing Time → Cached files prevent redundant computations.

Optimizes Performance → Minimizes I/O operations by keeping cached files.  


 How to Clear Parcel Cache?
If you face errors due to caching, try clearing the cache:

npx parcel clean
