why jsx - prevois steps were not a developer friendly there for we started using jsx

<!-- import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const containerDiv1 = React.createElement('div',{id:"container1" , key:"container1"},[  //first you need select root node
    React.createElement('h1',{className:"h1" ,key: "h1-1"},"hey this is react h1"),
    React.createElement('h2',{className:"h1" , key:"h2-1"},"hey this is react h2")
]);


const containerDiv2 = React.createElement("div",{id:"container2" , key:"container2"},[
    React.createElement('h1',{className:"h1", key:"h1-2"},"hey this is react h1"),
    React.createElement('h2',{className:"h1" , key:"h2-2"},"hey this is react h2")
]);

const parentDiv = React.createElement('div',{key:"parentDiv"},[containerDiv1,containerDiv2]);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); //this where you need to render
root.render(parentDiv); -->


this method was complecated 

there for we  use jsz

//jsx build by facebook developer

<!-- const jsxHeading = <h1>i am heading from JSX</h1>

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(jsxHeading); -->

code can be written like this using jsx

->jbrowser does'nt know about jsx there is babel which helps to connect it with this
->jsx is normal react element and java script object


 What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React.

It allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

JSX makes React code more readable and easier to write.

üîπ Why Use JSX?
‚úî Looks like HTML ‚Üí Easy to understand.
‚úî Helps create UI components quickly.
‚úî More readable than React.createElement().
‚úî JSX gets converted into JavaScript (React.createElement) behind the scenes.




############# babel ###############

üîπ What is Babel?
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript (ES6+) into older versions (ES5) so that browsers can understand it.

It helps React, JSX, and other modern JS features work on all browsers.

üîπ Why Use Babel?
‚úî Converts JSX to JavaScript (React uses JSX, which browsers don‚Äôt understand).
‚úî Ensures compatibility with older browsers.
‚úî Supports latest JavaScript features like ES6, ES7, etc.
‚úî Improves performance by optimizing code.






################## diff btw normal html and jsx####
1Ô∏è‚É£ Syntax:

Normal HTML uses standard HTML.

JSX looks like HTML but follows JavaScript rules.

2Ô∏è‚É£ JavaScript Integration:

Normal HTML does not allow JavaScript directly.

JSX allows embedding JavaScript inside {}.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Attributes:

In HTML, attributes are written as class, for, etc.

In JSX, use className instead of class and htmlFor instead of for.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Self-Closing Tags:

In HTML, self-closing tags like <br> and <img> are optional.

In JSX, self-closing tags must end with / (e.g., <br />, <img />).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Event Handling:

In HTML, events are written like onclick="myFunction()".

In JSX, use camelCase like onClick={myFunction}.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Comments:

HTML uses <!-- Comment -->.

JSX uses {/* Comment */}.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Parent Element Requirement:

HTML does not require a single parent element.

JSX must have a single parent element wrapping everything.



exapmle 
const age = 21;
const jsxHeading = (
    <div className="container">
     <h1 id="heading"> {age} </h1>
    </div>
 )
